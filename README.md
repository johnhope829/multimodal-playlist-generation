# 🎵 Multimodal Personalized Playlist Generator

This project uses deep learning to generate music playlists based on your **mood** and **activity**. It analyzes facial expressions, biometric signals, and motion data to understand your current state, then recommends songs that match your vibe.

---

## 🔍 What It Does

- Detects your **emotion** from facial images  
- Analyzes **stress levels** using biosignals  
- Recognizes **physical activity** (e.g. walking, resting)  
- Combines all this to create a **128-dimensional user state vector**  
- Matches that state to songs using a **shared embedding space**  
- Recommends a playlist using **cosine similarity** and **Spotify API**

## 🧠 Components

### 🧱 Input Models

- `FacialModel` → CNN (trained on FER-2013)
- `BiometricModel` → LSTM (trained on WESAD)
- `ActivityModel` → CNN-LSTM (trained on HAR / Capture-24)

### 🔀 Fusion

- Combines outputs from the above into a **user context vector**

### 🎵 Music Matching

- Songs embedded using valence, tempo, energy, etc.
- Contrastive or triplet loss aligns user states to matching songs
- Playlist generated by ranking similar songs

## 📁 Datasets Used

- **FER-2013**: Facial expressions  
- **WESAD**: Biometric stress signals  
- **HAR Smartphones & Capture-24**: Physical activity data  
- **Million Songs Dataset**: Annotated audio features  
- **Spotify API**: Live song metadata and availability

## 🛠 How It Works Without Users

You don’t need real user data. The system uses **simulated match/mismatch pairs** based on:
- Emotion + Activity templates (e.g., "stressed + running")
- Matching with compatible song features (e.g., high energy, high tempo)
- Contrastive learning or triplet loss to align context and song embeddings
